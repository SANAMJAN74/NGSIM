NGSIM Project:
processing and modeling data from the publicly available NGSIM (Next Generation Simulation) dataset. The main objectives are:
1. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
  - Extract relevant vehicle trajectory data from the NGSIM dataset.
  - Structure the dataset for use in time series and decision-making models.

2. Maneuver Recognition
  + Implement and train various time series models to classify driving maneuvers:
    - idden Markov Models (HMM)
    - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
    - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
    - Bidirectional LSTM

3. Decision-Making Analysis
  + Train models to predict feasible driving decisions using the cleaned dataset:
    -  Decision Trees
    -  Neural Networks

4. Model Evaluation
   +  Evaluate each model using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
   +  Compare performance across different architectures for maneuver recognition and decision-making.
